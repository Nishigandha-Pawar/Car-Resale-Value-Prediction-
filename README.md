# 🚗 Car Resale Value Prediction  


## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the **resale value of cars** using machine learning.  
By training on historical car data, the model can estimate the resale price of a car based on its features such as age, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and other attributes.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build a machine learning model to predict car resale prices accurately.  
- Help **buyers and sellers** make better decisions in the used car market.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Model Performance  
- **R² Score (Training):** 0.9866  
- **R² Score (Testing):** 0.9899  

👉 These results show that the model provides **highly accurate predictions**.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
The car resale value prediction model works very well and gives accurate results.  
It can help buyers know a fair price before buying a used car and help sellers set the right price when selling.
